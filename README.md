# ACE — Annotation Coding Environment

ACE is a qualitative coding tool that I developed for use with my research group at The University of Sydney. We wanted a way to select sections of text and assign qualitative codes and annotations to them but found existing tools to be unintuitive. Most importantly, I realised that we were using perhaps 5% of the features of expensive commercial software.

As both a research software engineer and data scientist I realised that I may be able to improve my quality of life and started working on a simple text highlight tool that ended up becoming ACE. ACE does only a *few* things right now. **I do not intend to add anything more than the current feature set** (bevause this is a personal project). These are what ACE does:

- Import your texts, build a codebook, highlight passages and assign codes and notes to sources
- Export your annotations and codebook for further analysis
- Compare coding across team members with built-in inter-coder reliability metrics

I built ACE for myself and my colleagues, so it will probably be nothing like any qualitative coding tool you have used. For example, it is quite keyboard-centric and solves many import/export issues that I had with the existing software that I used.

**Note: I use Anthropic's Claude as a copilot, but all code is audited and verified before they are pushed.** Just putting this here so that it can be part of your decision making process of whether to use ACE or not.

## Download

Pre-built installers are on the [Releases page](https://github.com/januarharianto/annotation-coding-environment/releases/latest), but I encourage you to install from source:

- **macOS (Apple Silicon)** — `ACE_*_aarch64.dmg`. Open, drag ACE to Applications. First launch: right-click → Open to bypass Gatekeeper.
- **Windows** — `ACE_*_x64-setup.exe`. Run the installer. SmartScreen may warn — click "More info" → "Run anyway".

Intel Macs are not currently supported. Neither build is code-signed yet.

## Install from source

You need some experience with using the command line on either macOS or Windows.

On Windows, install Git first so the `git clone` command below works:

```
winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget
```

If `winget` is unavailable, install Git for Windows from <https://git-scm.com/download/win>, then open a new PowerShell window.

In the Terminal or PowerShell, install uv. On macOS and Linux:

```
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | less
```

On Windows:

```
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

Then, run the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/januarharianto/annotation-coding-environment.git
cd annotation-coding-environment
uv run ace
```


ACE will open in your web browser.

In the future, you only need to run the following:


```
cd annotation-coding-environment
uv run ace
```
