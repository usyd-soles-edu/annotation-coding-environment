# Changelog

## 0.14.5

### Changes

- **Applied codes timeline** — moved applied codes into a persistent right-side timeline panel with compact rows, colour markers, and text-preview highlighting.
- **Notes drawer overlay** — the source note drawer now opens over the applied-codes panel so the right column keeps a stable footprint.
- **Coded-text selection polish** — the coded-text view now uses the same selected-code styling as the coding sidebar.

## 0.10.0

### Features

- **Keyboard-centric sidebar** — ARIA treeview with roving tabindex, arrow key navigation, Tab zone cycling (text → header → search → tree), Enter to apply codes, F2 to rename, Alt+arrows to indent/reorder, drag-and-drop for codes and groups
- **Top bar redesign** — ACE wordmark with subtitle over sidebar column, source name centred over text panel, clickable flag toggle with toast feedback, ? help button
- **Agreement overhaul** — streamlined flow (choose files → auto-compute → results), pooled overall computation, expanded pairwise metrics, minimalist tables with interpretation labels, bib-backed references, raw data CSV export for R/Python reproducibility
- **Codebook CSV import** — "Codebook ▾" sidebar menu with Import/Export, native file picker, sidebar-style preview dialog with new/exists badges, empty state link
- **Apply codes from sidebar** — click a code row or Enter on first search match to apply to focused sentence, with filter auto-clear and focus return

### Fixes

- CapsLock keyboard shortcut compatibility
- Focus restoration across HTMX sidebar swaps
